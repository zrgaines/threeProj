# Gall3ry.js

Gall3ry.js is a visual art gallery for projects made in three.js. The goal is to make a page where visual artists can find inspiration.

## Technologies used:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. jQuery
  4. Three.js
  5. CSS Animations.
  
## Known Bugs
  1. Performance issues
    * Due to the multiple renders on one page, frame rate drops
    * This makes me very sad.
    * Multiple possible solutions
  2. Browser support
    * Does not exist.
  3. Responsive design
    * Nope lol

## Ice Box
  1. Fix performance -- Possible solutions
    * Render the canvas containers with a framework, e.g. React
    * Put all projects into one renderer, display them in seperate scenes
    * Make the on click function within the three.js files, instead of jQuery
  2. Browser Support
  3. Responsive Design
  4. Add more projects
    * My goal is to make this page a three.js portfolio for myself
  5. MORE CSS ANIMATIONS!!!!
